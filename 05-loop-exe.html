      // Exercise 1: Loop Through Numbers
      // Objective: Write a for loop to print all even numbers from 2 to 100. Ensure each number is printed on a new line in the console.

      for (let i = 2; i <= 100; i++) {
        if (i % 2 == 0) {
          console.log(i);
        }
      }

      // Exercise 2: Array Summation
      /*
      Objective: Create a for loop that sums all the elements of a given array of integers. Display the sum after the loop completes. Test the loop with the array [10, 20, 30, 40, 50].
      */
      const numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
      let total = 0;

      for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
        total += numbers[i];
      }

      console.log(`Total = ${total.toFixed(2)}`);

      // Exercise 3: Character Counter
      /*
      Objective: Use a for loop to count how many times a specific character appears in a string. For example, count how many times the letter 'a' appears in the string "banana". Print the count to the console.
      */
      let countWord = "banana";
      console.log(countWord.split("a").length - 1);

      // Exercise 4: List Processing
      /*
        Objective: Write a for loop that processes a list of names (given as an array) and prints each name with its corresponding length. Example array: ["Alice", "Bob", "Alexander"].
      */

      let staff = ["Alice", "Bob", "Alexander"];

      for (let i = 0; i < staff.length; i++) {
        console.log(
          `Name: ${staff[i]} ---- Character Count: ${staff[i].length}`
