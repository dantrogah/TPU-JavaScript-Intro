      // Exercise 1: Create a Simple Object
      // Task: Define a JavaScript object named person with properties for firstName, lastName, and age. Use console.log to print the properties.
      const person = {
        firstName: "Daniel",
        lastName: "Doe",

      // Task: Define an object with properties name, occupation, and age. Delete the occupation property and print the object before and after the deletion.
