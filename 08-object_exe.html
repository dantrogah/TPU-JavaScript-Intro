      // Exercise 1: Create a Simple Object
      // Task: Define a JavaScript object named person with properties for firstName, lastName, and age. Use console.log to print the properties.
      const person = {
        firstName: "Daniel",
        lastName: "Doe",

      // Task: Create an object representing a car with properties like make, model, and year. Display each property separately in the console.
      const car = {
        make: "Toyota",
        model: "Camry",

      // Task: Define an object with several properties. Write a script that loops through the properties and prints out the property names and their values.
      const codingBook = {
        title: "JavaScript Basics",
        author: "Daniel Ahiatrogah",

      // Task: Create an array of objects where each object represents a different pet and has properties for type, name, and age. Print each pet's information.
      const pets = [
        { type: "Dog", name: "Buddy", age: 2 },
        { type: "Cat", name: "Cocco", age: 1 },

      // Exercise 8: Deleting Properties
      // Task: Define an object with properties name, occupation, and age. Delete the occupation property and print the object before and after the deletion.
      const employee = {
        name: "Vanessa",
        occupation: "Data Scientist",
        age: 31,
